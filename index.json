John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.\nBasic information about Markdown: To create a title, use the sign ( # ), for example, look above! Do you see big text? It is the title!\nTo make the text bold, enclose it in double asterisks.\nTo set an italic font for the text, enclose it in single asterisks.\nTo set bold and italicized text, enclose it in triple asterisks.\nThe bulleted list can be formatted using asterisks or dashes:\n yes. it is a fact.  The ordered list can be formatted using the appropriate numbers:\n Don’t you believe me? See for yourself.  Conclusion: Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages; in addition, many platforms and frameworks support Markdown. For example, Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.\n","date":1652496969,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652496969,"objectID":"bd238f54b82fdcd586f8f7e438599565","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T05:56:09+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"Let’s tell about Markdown.","tags":[],"title":"Markdown","type":"post"},{"authors":["Arina O.

Aristova"],"categories":[],"content":"Let’s talk about version control Git. Version Control Systems (VCS) are used when several people work on one project. Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nIn classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.\nVersion control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nThe Git version control system is a set of command-line programs. They can be accessed from the terminal by entering the git command with various options. Due to the fact that Git is a distributed version control system, a backup copy of the local storage can be made by simple copying or archiving.\n","date":1651927033,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651927033,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T15:37:13+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Version control Git.","tags":[],"title":"Git","type":"post"},{"authors":["Arina O.
