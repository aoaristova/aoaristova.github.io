But initially programming was intended to solve scientific problems. In addition, programming itself is a science, which will be useful to learn about for those who decide to link their careers with computer development.\nScientific programming is a highly oriented style of programming for scientific computing. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality.\nScientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.\nA number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù management systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their implementation; waiting for robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities.\nSpecializations üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran, it has many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively. Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other ‚Äúscientific‚Äù languages: Fortran, C++, C#.\nIn turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.\nThe future of the programmer-scientist profession üßë‚Äçüíº Programming drives science üíª, which drives technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the 21st century: a microwave oven, a mobile phone, an 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist what peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every house tomorrow.\nIn the hands of the programmer-scientist ‚å®Ô∏è are the tools not only to develop the industry, but also to improve the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to predict and prevent climate, financial, and humanitarian disasters.\n","date":1653705817,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653705817,"objectID":"c72bb874addf0a7faec47748fc7157e3","permalink":"https://example.com/post/programming_and_science/","publishdate":"2022-05-28T05:43:37+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/programming_and_science/","section":"post","summary":"Let's discuss it.","tags":[],"title":"Science and Programming üñ±Ô∏è","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Every week I make a wish that I will spend the next week more productively and interestingly.

Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.\nIn classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.\nVersion control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.\nThe Git version control system is a set of command-line programs. They can be accessed from the terminal by entering the git command with various options. Due to the fact that Git is a distributed version control system, a backup copy of the local storage can be made by simple copying or archiving.\n","date":1651927033,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651927033,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2022-05-07T15:37:13+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Version control Git.","tags":[],"title":"Git","type":"post"},{"authors":["Arina O.

For example, it is enough to recall Bill Gates with Microsoft or Steve Jobs with Apple, who started their activities literally in basements or garages. But Intel was created differently.\nThe founders of the company were not young ambitious rebels, but respectable men who had a solid reputation in the industry at that time. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce did not need to look for money for years to launch the enterprise, instead they collected $ 2.3 million in half a day. Soon they were joined as a co-founder by Andrew Grove, who for many years became the head of production at Intel. And although Robert Noyce himself often called the company a ‚Äúthree‚Äìheaded monster,‚Äù in fact, another person was present during its creation - marketing star Bob Graham.\nWhat seems to me important and interesting in the structure of the company. üñ• At that time, all technology companies had a clearly established ‚Äúvertical of power‚Äù, that is, each employee could interact only with his immediate superior and those who are below him in this structure. No other way. However, Noyce and Moore wanted everyone who has interesting ideas not to be afraid to express them, and everyone who has a question to ask it. Thus, no one (even the founders) could refuse to help or answer someone‚Äôs question. Even meetings at Intel were held in, so to speak, in an ‚Äúopen‚Äù format, that is, anyone who thought they could be useful at this meeting could attend it.\nWhat‚Äôs it? Is it a revolution or just a stage in the industry that no one will notice? üíª When the company was particularly in need of orders, an offer was received for the design and production of a circuit of eight logic chips designed specifically for the customer‚Äôs calculator, however, due to certain circumstances, another decision was made ‚Äì to assemble a miniature household computer and program it to perform arithmetic operations for the customer‚Äôs calculator. As a result, having lost a significant part of the profit, as a result of the revision of the license agreement, Intel gets the rights to sell the design to other consumers. It was this decision that allowed Intel to become the company it is. However, the 4004 (the first microprocessor based on this chip), although it was an innovation, did not have the opportunity to take a place ‚Äúinside real computers‚Äù, since it could process only 4 bits of information at the same time.\nSubsequently, Intel has already released an eight-bit 8008, which in many respects corresponded, but also in many ways inferior to the 4004.\nIn 1978, it appeared, the first hexadecimal 8086 processor, it was backward compatible with the previous model, which allowed using the texts of already written programs. Then the 8088 also appears, built on the basis of the 8086, half of the address bus was disabled, and it was limited to performing eight-bit operations, but it was significantly faster than previous eight-bit developments.\nThe x86 architecture became the industry standard, in 1982 the 80186 and 80286 were released. Reducing the number of individual chips and simultaneously increasing the number of functions of the processor itself made it possible to make processors more productive, and the system simpler and cheaper.\nThe first 32-bit i386 processor (80386) was released in 1985, which also retained backward compatibility with 8086 and 80286. i486 was released in 1989, contained more than a million (1.2 million) transistors, and worked twice as fast as 80386.\nAt that time, computer buyers paid attention only to the brand of the PC itself, and did not attach any importance to what kind of processor was inside. Therefore, in order to show users that the main part of the computer is the processor, and it should serve as the basis for choosing a PC, Intel decides on an unusual step ‚Äì the ‚ÄúIntel Inside‚Äù advertising campaign.\nIn 1993, the Pentium appeared. And, it would seem, Intel is ahead of everyone again, but no!\nEverything is going well until an unknown professor Thomas Knisley decides to divide one number by another. And here‚Äôs the bad luck! Gets an incorrect result, and realizes that this is an error in the processor. The scandal is growing at an incredible rate.\nPentium Pro appeared as a ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù for Pentium, but eventually becomes more of a processor for servers and workstations.\nIn 1997, the real replacement for the Pentium was the Pentium II.\nIn the first versions of the Pentium III there were slightly less than 10 million transistors, and already another model (one of the last) contains about 44 million.\nThe Pentium 4 barely overtook its predecessor.\nPentium M is an exceptional architecture for laptops.\nIn recent years, Intel‚Äôs main goal has been to reduce power consumption and, as a result, reduce temperature, new processors do not differ as much in performance ‚Ä¶","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Let's talk about Intel!","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Intel üñ•  üñ•Ô∏è üíª","type":"project"},{"authors":["Arina O.
