      <title>Science and Programming üñ±Ô∏è</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/progr_and_s/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 05:43:37 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/progr_and_s/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Programming is often mentioned in an applied context. üñ•Ô∏è It seems that only mobile applications, Internet systems and special effects for cinema are created with its help. But initially programming was intended to solve scientific problems. In addition, programming itself is a science, which will be useful to learn about for those who decide to link their careers with computer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific programming is a highly oriented style of programming for scientific computing. It is distinguished from other types of programming by the extreme correctness and stability of the final product, the strict separation of scientific and interface parts, the individuality of algorithms, and the predominance of efficiency over universality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific programming is at the heart of any modern global research. All advanced technologies - from quantum computers to space programs - would not be possible without scientific programmers who can provide scientists with a reliable and accurate tool for making discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of branches of science directly depend on the level of development of scientific programming. So, unmanned vehicles, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù management systems for urban and agricultural management, stock exchanges are waiting for their implementation; waiting for robotics, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence that surpasses human capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;specializations-&#34;&gt;Specializations üôé‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists use various programming languages, the choice of which depends on the type of problem and the preferences of the author. Historically, the first high-level programming language is Fortran, it has many debugged libraries of mathematical statistics and libraries for solving differential equations, which is relevant for economics and biology, respectively. Python has a simpler syntax, which is also suitable for programming mathematical calculations. The Python language is used for data processing in mathematics, physics, economics, biology, chemistry and can work with some other &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; languages: Fortran, C++, C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, C# allows you to program on the .NET platform, adapt the program to the common language runtime (CLR), and accelerate development within the framework of operational scientific sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-future-of-the-programmer-scientist-profession-&#34;&gt;The future of the programmer-scientist profession üßë‚Äçüíº&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programming drives science üíª, which drives technological progress. Inventions that were considered revolutionary yesterday serve everyday needs in the 21st century: a microwave oven, a mobile phone, an 8-bit home computer. It depends on the programmer-scientist what peaks science will reach today and which of them will enter every house tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hands of the programmer-scientist ‚å®Ô∏è are the tools not only to develop the industry, but also to improve the overall quality of life. Such a specialist increases the prognostic function of humanity, helping to predict and prevent climate, financial, and humanitarian disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What was my last week like?</title>

      <guid>https://example.com/post/last_week3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every week I make a wish that I will spend the next week more productively and interestingly. Surely, you have already noticed this in my regular posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for this week, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say whether it worked out this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand üêá, I did not make much progress in my studies this week, although I still answered in class and did all my homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand üê§, I was able to achieve the goal that I set myself a week ago. I met and talked with friends. We discussed various topics, inflated balloons and walked around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring is in full swing üçÉ and summer is just around the corner ‚õ±Ô∏è! I think many of you are tired, as am I. I assure you that very soon we will be able to relax and take care of ourselves and loved ones. But it takes a little more effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes, Arina.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Report</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/report/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 06:28:36 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-tell-about-report-&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s tell about report! üìù&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; we do laboratory work. Then we should prepare a report on our labs. We perform reports for laboratory work in the lightweight markup language &lt;strong&gt;markdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-markdown-‚Ñπ&#34;&gt;What is MARKDOWN? ‚ÑπÔ∏è&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-we-execute-the-report-&#34;&gt;How do we execute the report? üíª&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each laboratory work, we have a &lt;em&gt;template&lt;/em&gt; that we need to fill in with all the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title page of the report contains information about the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of the lab, the &lt;em&gt;topic&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;author&lt;/em&gt; of the report.
Next, we describe the &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of the laboratory work, the &lt;em&gt;task&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a &lt;em&gt;theoretical introduction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the description of the main part of the work begins. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description of the work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should describe the accomplishment of the work as &lt;em&gt;fully and clearly&lt;/em&gt; as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, we can divide the job description into several parts, insert screenshots, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;for-what---&#34;&gt;For what? ü§î ‚ùì üí°&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a report is an &lt;strong&gt;important stage&lt;/strong&gt; of laboratory work, because it is during the execution of the report that the material is consolidated and its full awareness occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New post about last week again!</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/last_week2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I decided to spend the next week better than the previous one. And a week ago I promised that this week would be more colorful and productive&amp;hellip;ü•ÄüíÆüåº&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-did-i-manage-to-keep-my-promise&#34;&gt;But did I manage to keep my promise?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t waste any time&lt;/strong&gt; this week again. I studied a lot üìö, did all the tasks üñãÔ∏è, read üìñ, watched TV shows üì∫. But unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even get to meet my friends this week üò≠.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-this-case-is-it-possible-to-call-this-week-productive-&#34;&gt;In this case, is it possible to call this week productive? ü§î&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that it is &lt;strong&gt;very important&lt;/strong&gt; to find time for rest and communication. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed. I hope I won&amp;rsquo;t make this mistake again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;will-the-next-week-more-productive&#34;&gt;Will the next week more productive?!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I can be more productive next week, so I won&amp;rsquo;t promise it this time. However, I can promise myself to &lt;strong&gt;try to do everything I need&lt;/strong&gt; next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your attention! See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;basic-information-about-markdown&#34;&gt;Basic information about Markdown:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a title, use the sign ( # ), for example, look above! Do you see big text? It is the title!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the text &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, enclose it in double asterisks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set an &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; font for the text, enclose it in single asterisks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bold and italicized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; text, enclose it in triple
asterisks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulleted list can be formatted using asterisks or dashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is a fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ordered list can be formatted using the appropriate numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt you believe me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages; in addition, many platforms and frameworks support Markdown. For example, Markdown plugins exist for every major blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The last post about the last week!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The study is finally ending. This is the last post about the past week this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting adventure. A lot has been done, created and studied this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of work this week. I have completed the last laboratory work in this discipline. Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to meet my friends again, but I had to be patient a little bit, and it will happen more often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very soon we will go on a well-deserved vacation! It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy and interesting year, but we&amp;rsquo;re all tired. And this means that we need to rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With best wishes! üíñ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon! üíñ&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I spent last week</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/last_week1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 05:17:42 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/last_week1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;has-this-week-been-productive&#34;&gt;Has this week been productive?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago, I promised myself that I would spend this week &lt;strong&gt;even more productively&lt;/strong&gt; than last week. I hope I managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I was still very busy studying. I did a lot of homework üìñ, worked in classes at the university üìö, studied additional material üíª.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I &lt;strong&gt;did not forget about the rest&lt;/strong&gt;. I managed to watch a couple of episodes of my favorite TV show üé¨, read a little üìö and meet with friends üéâ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this &lt;strong&gt;was not enough for me to feel good&lt;/strong&gt;, this week I felt very &lt;strong&gt;stressed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tired&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, I hope that next week I will be able to distribute time both to study and to rest in order to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-general&#34;&gt;In general,&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spring has finally come! üåøüå∫üåû We should leave the house more often and go out with our loved ones. But we can do this only after all the cases are finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why I &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt; that next week will be no less &lt;strong&gt;productive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;interesting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SystemD</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/systemd/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 05:17:42 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.com/post/systemd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In UNIX-like operating systems, and in Linux in particular, after the kernel is loaded, the initialization of the Linux system, services, and components begins. The initialization process is responsible for this, it is started by the kernel after the end of the boot and has a PID of 1, it is also executed while the system is running. But about everything in order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-an-initialization-system&#34;&gt;What is an initialization system?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when we just start the operating system, literally open, for example, a terminal, a large number of processes are already running. Although we did not launch them manually, they were launched automatically by other programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our actions in the operating system, in fact, is some kind of program. For example, just logging in, launching the browser, and so on. To make all this happen, certain processes are started. Such programs are called daemons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, it turns out that in order for the same login to be performed or to the browser, certain daemons must work. In turn, in order for them to work, they must be somehow launched by someone or something. This is what the INITIALIZATION SYSTEM is designed for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various Linux initialization systems: SYSTEM V INIT, OPENRC, RUNINIT, UPSTART. But I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about SystemD today. This initialization system was first introduced by default in Fedora 15, and is now already used in many popular Linux distributions, for example, CentOS. For example, I looked at which initialization system is on my virtual machine (Linux, Fedora distribution), and it&amp;rsquo;s SystemD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initialization system is the first process launched in the user space. Its PID (Process ID) is 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-did-systemd-appear&#34;&gt;How did SystemD appear?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SystemD was developed by Red Hat software engineers Lennart Poetering and Kay Sievers. Initially, it was a project to replace the standard well-known Linux System V init in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An experimental version of SystemD was already presented in April 2010 in the Poettering blog called &amp;ldquo;Rethinking PID 1&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011, Fedora included SystemD by default for the first time, replacing the standard SysVinit at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the developers argued a lot about the functionality and advantages of SystemD and SysVinit. Some even believed that the dislike and carping about SystemD were based not so much on real shortcomings as personal dislike of developers and undesirable attitudes towards change processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the SystemD initialization system, its work. After starting, the initialization system should start the daemons. But this is not just a list of programs that should be run. Some of them need to be launched before others, some programs may conflict with each other, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to determine which programs and when to run, to enable the user to decide which programs to run and which not to run. These are the tasks that SystemD faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, it should be understood that the role of the initialization system, in short, is to launch the OS. That is, the purpose of the initialization system is to make sure that all the daemons necessary for the correct operation of certain processes are started. However, SystemD is not just an initialization system. SystemD positions itself as a system and service manager, it binds and replaces many OS components, that is, it is responsible for much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SystemD is a service initialization and management system in Linux, which in the 2010s practically replaced the Init initialization system, which was traditional, which was not accepted unambiguously, but is still used in many distributions today. The main goal is to have full control over all processes during their startup and before their completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, SystemD is a relatively young Linux initialization system, for the first time the SystemD initialization system appeared by default in Fedora 15, and then began to be used in many popular Linux OS distributions. SystemD is not only an initialization process that supports a large number of features, but also a set of tools that allow you to manage the services and capabilities of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-version-control-git&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about version control Git.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Control Systems (VCS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are used when several people work on one project. Usually, the main project tree is stored in a local or remote repository, to which access is configured for project participants. When making changes to the project content, the version control system allows you to fix them, combine changes made by different project participants, roll back to any earlier version of the project, if required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In classical version control systems, a centralized model is used, assuming a single repository for storing files. Most version control functions are performed by a special server. The project participant (user) receives the version of files he needs before starting work through certain commands. After making changes, the user places the new version in the repository. At the same time, previous versions are not deleted from the central repository and you can return to them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version control systems support the ability to track and resolve conflicts that may arise when several people work on a single file. You can merge (merge) changes made by different participants (automatically or manually), manually select the desired version, cancel the changes altogether or lock files for modification. Depending on the settings, the lock does not allow other users to get a working copy or prevents changing the working copy of the file by means of the OS file system, thus providing privileged access to only one user working with the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Git version control system is a set of command-line programs. They can be accessed from the terminal by entering the git command with various options. Due to the fact that Git is a distributed version control system, a backup copy of the local storage can be made by simple copying or archiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this post. I will tell. how I spent this week. This week has been quite productive. I completed all my homework, actively worked in classes at the institute. In addition, I also had time to watch TV shows, read a book and meet friends. I plan to do even more next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-review-of-the-week&#34;&gt;My review of the week.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I would like to say that I have worked hard this week. But next week I plan to do it even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Intel üñ•  üñ•Ô∏è üíª</title>
      <link>https://example.com/project/example/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;lets-talk-about-intel-&#34;&gt;Let‚Äôs talk about Intel! üñ•Ô∏è&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, many people know the prototype of the emergence of successful technology firms: a modest beginning, a struggle with circumstances, outsider founders and more. For example, it is enough to recall Bill Gates with Microsoft or Steve Jobs with Apple, who started their activities literally in basements or garages. But Intel was created differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of the company were not young ambitious rebels, but respectable men who had a solid reputation in the industry at that time. Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce did not need to look for money for years to launch the enterprise, instead they collected $ 2.3 million in half a day. Soon they were joined as a co-founder by Andrew Grove, who for many years became the head of production at Intel. And although Robert Noyce himself often called the company a &amp;ldquo;three‚Äìheaded monster,&amp;rdquo; in fact, another person was present during its creation - marketing star Bob Graham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-seems-to-me-important-and-interesting-in-the-structure-of-the-company-&#34;&gt;What seems to me important and interesting in the structure of the company. üñ•&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, all technology companies had a clearly established &amp;ldquo;vertical of power&amp;rdquo;, that is, each employee could interact only with his immediate superior and those who are below him in this structure. No other way. However, Noyce and Moore wanted everyone who has interesting ideas not to be afraid to express them, and everyone who has a question to ask it. Thus, no one (even the founders) could refuse to help or answer someone&amp;rsquo;s question. Even meetings at Intel were held in, so to speak, in an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; format, that is, anyone who thought they could be useful at this meeting could attend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-it-is-it-a-revolution-or-just-a-stage-in-the-industry-that-no-one-will-notice-&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s it? Is it a revolution or just a stage in the industry that no one will notice? üíª&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the company was particularly in need of orders, an offer was received for the design and production of a circuit of eight logic chips designed specifically for the customer&amp;rsquo;s calculator, however, due to certain circumstances, another decision was made ‚Äì to assemble a miniature household computer and program it to perform arithmetic operations for the customer&amp;rsquo;s calculator. As a result, having lost a significant part of the profit, as a result of the revision of the license agreement, Intel gets the rights to sell the design to other consumers. It was this decision that allowed Intel to become the company it is. However, the 4004 (the first microprocessor based on this chip), although it was an innovation, did not have the opportunity to take a place &amp;ldquo;inside real computers&amp;rdquo;, since it could process only 4 bits of information at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Intel has already released an eight-bit 8008, which in many respects corresponded, but also in many ways inferior to the 4004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1978, it appeared, the first hexadecimal 8086 processor, it was backward compatible with the previous model, which allowed using the texts of already written programs.  Then the 8088 also appears, built on the basis of the 8086, half of the address bus was disabled, and it was limited to performing eight-bit operations, but it was significantly faster than previous eight-bit developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The x86 architecture became the industry standard, in 1982 the 80186 and 80286 were released. Reducing the number of individual chips and simultaneously increasing the number of functions of the processor itself made it possible to make processors more productive, and the system simpler and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 32-bit i386 processor (80386) was released in 1985, which also retained backward compatibility with 8086 and 80286. i486 was released in 1989, contained more than a million (1.2 million) transistors, and worked twice as fast as 80386.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, computer buyers paid attention only to the brand of the PC itself, and did not attach any importance to what kind of processor was inside. Therefore, in order to show users that the main part of the computer is the processor, and it should serve as the basis for choosing a PC, Intel decides on an unusual step ‚Äì the &amp;ldquo;Intel Inside&amp;rdquo; advertising campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993, the Pentium appeared. And, it would seem, Intel is ahead of everyone again, but no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is going well until an unknown professor Thomas Knisley decides to divide one number by another. And here&amp;rsquo;s the bad luck! Gets an incorrect result, and realizes that this is an error in the processor. The scandal is growing at an incredible rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentium Pro appeared as a &amp;ldquo;replacement&amp;rdquo; for Pentium, but eventually becomes more of a processor for servers and workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, the real replacement for the Pentium was the Pentium II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first versions of the Pentium III there were slightly less than 10 million transistors, and already another model (one of the last) contains about 44 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentium 4 barely overtook its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentium M is an exceptional architecture for laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Intel&amp;rsquo;s main goal has been to reduce power consumption and, as a result, reduce temperature, new processors do not differ as much in performance from previous ones as before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, created more than half a century ago, was different from other companies in the industry from the very moment of its creation, and even then it was not difficult to predict its success. However, no one could have imagined such a triumph, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost from the very beginning of the company&amp;rsquo;s work, the most interesting history of the emergence and development of microprocessors originates. It is unknown what the industry would be like now if it were not for a number of decisions made by the founders and heads of the corporation, as well as the long-term work of brilliant engineers from Intel, whose developments served as the foundation of the technological revolution of the XX century. Today Intel can rightfully be called the largest and most famous corporation for the production of microprocessors.&lt;/p&gt;
